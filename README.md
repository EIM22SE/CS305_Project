# CS305 Dynamic Survey Form Project

## Overview

The CS305 Dynamic Survey Form project is a course project developed for the CS305 class. This project aims to create an interactive survey form "that allows users to dynamically add and remove questions in real-time". The project showcases implementations in three different programming languages: JavaScript, C#, and Python, each demonstrating the unique features and capabilities of the respective language.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories, each containing the implementation in a different programming language:

- **JavaScript**: Located in the `javascript/` directory, this version uses HTML and JavaScript to create a client-side dynamic survey form.
- **C#**: The `csharp/` directory contains the C# implementation using ASP.NET Core to build a web application for the dynamic survey.
- **Python**: The `python/` directory features the Python version, which utilizes the Flask framework to create a web-based dynamic survey form.

## Features

- **Dynamic Question Management**: Users can add and remove questions in real-time.
- **Cross-Language Implementation**: Each version implements the same core functionality, allowing for comparison of language features and performance.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: Each implementation provides a simple and intuitive user interface for survey creation.
- **Data Handling**: Each version includes functionality to handle and display the survey data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
